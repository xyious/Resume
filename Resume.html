                    <li>Implemented an automated CI/CD pipeline with unit and integration tests. Created unit tests in
                        Jest/Enzyme. Created integration tests in cypress. Tied it all together with Looper (in house

                    <li>Moved several applications from old build tools and SVN to Jenkins and Github. Refactored code
                        of 4 closely related projects to use shared code instead of duplicated code. Replaced a lot of C
                        code with C++ code resulting in a significant increase in performance and stability.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Created a page that lists the best selling items and integrated it into the online shop system.
                        A query joining four database tables of the shop system returned every item that was purchased,
                        grouped by item number. The returned rows were added up and the resulting array was sorted by
                        total sales and later by sales in the past 30, 60 and 180 days.</li>
                    <li>Wrote a page listing all items, calculating the minimum instock levels based on sales and
                        delivery time. The php script would get all sales within the past 180 days from the database,
                        add the sales and sort the array by item name. Then it would output a table of all items and
                        highlight the instock levels of items with higher sales in 3 months than instock level orange
                        and the ones with more sales in 30 days than instock level red.</li>
                    <li>Made a shell script that saved a copy of the database every day. A simple bash script used
                        mysqladmin to dump the whole database into a file with a timestamp in the name. The script would
                        then parse the backup directory and delete all backups that were over 7 days old and didn't have
                        a 0 or 5 in the second "day" digit.</li>
                    <li>Removed malicious Javascript from 50+ php pages that were altered when our server was hacked.
                        Analyzed ftp and access logs and saved the important parts for the police.</li>
                    <li>Made a mirror of the online stores virtual machine using an ubuntu server virtualized with KVM
                        on an ubuntu server. Transfered changes made to the mirror to the production system.</li>

                    <li>Wrote software in C# .net that inserts a date and department before saving scanned mail as a
                        pdf.</li>
                    <li>Developed a program using windows communication foundation that would receive metadata about a
                        scanned document over the network and transform the metadata to conform to our enterprise
                        content management system's standards where the document and the metadata would be stored.</li>
                    <li>Worked as level 2 support, finding sourcecode for software that was in use and troubleshooting

                <ul>
                    <li>Wrote a program in C# to compare different versions of our logistics software to list the
                        changed files in an XML document.</li>
                    <li>Created a couple of programs that would analyse changes in .ini files and change .ini files
                        based on that analysis.</li>
                    <li>Made a program that would analyse different versions of the MSSQL database for our logistics
                        software and write changes in the schema into an XML document. Developed a small program that
                        listed 5 database columns and had a checkbox that, if checked or unchecked, would set a flag in
                        the MSSQL database.</li>
